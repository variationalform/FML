# FML

## Fundamentals of Machine Learning - course notes, code and auxiliary material

#### Purpose

Use to store and track Jupyter notebooks and other core material. 




#### Git - usage notes

This repo was originally set up on git hub and then, locally,

```bash
cd /to/parent/directory
git clone git@github.com:variationalform/FML.git
```

Then, for example, 
```bash
cd FML
git add notebooks/*
git add *
git add .gitignore 
git reset    # to undo and start again
git status
git commit -m 'Initial commit for notebooks'
git push
```
Note that `.gitignore` is a hidden file. It's worth collaborating with it though.
